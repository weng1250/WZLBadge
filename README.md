CHANGE LOG

 1. UIBarButtonItem badge is supported. UIBarButtonItem is kind of NSObject and its displayed view is invisiable. This version makes usage of UIBarButtonItem badge as to UIView.
 2. Slight adjustment for code structure to fit future extension.
 3. Other code optimization.



V1.0  at 2015.06.16

Base functions are completed, which is able to meet most of requirements.
